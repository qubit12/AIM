Extended Anderson impurity quantum model for semiconductor quantum dot arrays. The model contains a semiconducting QDA described by a Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonian, weakly connected (low hybridization Ï„) to N-leads (source and drain) which allow quantum transport and electric current through the structure.
